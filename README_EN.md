**OpenTrafficLight** is an open platform that provides traffic light countdown and real-time status prediction based on user-contributed data. We encourage all users to contribute and help build a smart traffic light system with real-time reporting and AI machine learning predictions.

Users can register an account, upload traffic light cycle data, and enjoy real-time voice alerts, route planning, and more. Additionally, the entire platform is open-source, allowing users to package and deploy the system offline, ensuring privacy.

**Expected release date: Summer 2025**
